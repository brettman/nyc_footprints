#### GO API to read and inspect a local copy of NYC building footprints db

There was a weird project on upwork that wanted an API built in Go to inspect some of the NYC building footprint data.  Seemed like an interesting way to explore some ***really basic*** golang in my freetime.  

Don't take any of this too seriously.
